Oodls
A charity-based web app designed to help reduce food waste. 
Users find the closest and most convenient food donation centres to take their waste food to.
Organisations can sign up and give their details and requirements for donations centres.
The app was built using Rails and Gmaps, and it was designed mobile-first using Foundation.
